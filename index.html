 <h1> About Open Studio (and me)</h1>
  <div class="left">
   <p>This is the story of how one workshop changed my life.</p>
    <p>Before I moved to Melbourne and got a job there as a service designer at a strategic design agency, I thought I knew what 'collaborative' meant.</p>
    <p>I'd taken my architecture training into my role as Lean project manager and later service designer, unaware that I was double-diamonding all over the place - working within context, thinking by making, translating ideas into form, switching scales, working iteratively and so on. Co-design didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>But my mind was truly blown when I went to my first ever open studio in Melbourne, which I also happened to be hosting. I had thought that being 'open' meant, primarily, being open to others' experiences and opinions, but the proposal I was working to stipulated an 'open studio' without any prep time. How? By just opening the big old studio doors, of course. Cue fear, dread and a realisation that I was truly not in Kansas (Dublin) any more.</p>
    <p>Our client's senior leaders arrived. I expected disappointment and confusion. They were enthralled and stayed for hours.  Turns out, anything less than fully open would have been a disservice to everyone.</p>
    <p>This one workshop rewired my brain and is the yardstick that I measure my work against.</p>

 <h1> What's Strategic Design?</h1>
  <div class="strategic_intro">
    <p>Strategic designers apply the skills and techniques of traditional design (like architecture, in my case) to complex, systemic and often abstract challenges. </p>
